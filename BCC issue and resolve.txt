ST1 BCC issue :  
1. halt BCC deploys .
2. initialise snapshots thro' dyn/admin
3. check agents state and switchable datastores 
4. if good run bcc deploy proj 
5. if bad check switchiable datasources and make sure the the one casing error is same as he first 
6. if not update the which is causing issue
in this case mobileagent (1st one) is good and shop-service is showing null so goto switchable and update source here its datasourceA. make sure that all check boxes are unchecked after you work is complete .
Last then run proj again
Note : make sure no deploy is in progress and its halted during any bcc work u do
