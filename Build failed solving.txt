*************************** Build Failed solving steps****************************************************

you see build failure, don't send mail, check the cause for failure and interact with Dev team and clear the cache by using below steps.


/development0/021/build/codebase/ATG/ATG11.1/ProjectInstall/

/development0/021/build/codebase/MID_ATG/ATG11.1/ProjectInstall/

/development0/021/build/codebase/GBL_ATG/ATG11.1/ProjectInstall/


And try manual build after setting classpath and even then if build fails then its not our issue. 


Sprintmobile(R8S) // 9QS build  always run main build first then run R8s/9QS build but if you think there is chance for duplicate jars showing up then
 clean this location before starting build

/development0/021/build/jenkins_workspace/jobs/<<release>>_R8S/workspace/source/modules/mobileWS/lib

Then during  build new copy of code will be checked out to build location


go to this path run below 2 commands

[webadmin@dvmkc409 Build]$ pwd
/development0/021/build/jenkins_workspace/jobs/MID18.6.4/workspace/sprint20_project/Build
[webadmin@dvmkc409 Build]$


ant clean-all
ant cleanCache 
 
then run manual build or jenkins build  we get result.


******************In manual build run************************
check the build/codebase/jenkins/MID18.11.2/*/*.ear
once dwloader is updated with latest timestamp then all builds are done, currently running support-app.

go to cd [webadmin@dvmkc409 dwloader]$ pwd
/development0/021/build/codebase/stage/jenkins/MID18.11.2/dwloader
